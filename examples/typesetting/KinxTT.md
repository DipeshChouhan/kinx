## Introduction

### What is Kinx Tiny Typesetting

This system is a small typesetting system written in Kinx.
Most of people knows the \\LaTeX\\footnote{Leslie Lamport, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LaTeX} is being used for that purpose,
but the \\TeX\\footnote{Donald E. Knuth, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TeX} system is very huge.
This system provides only a limited functionality,
but supports some of \\TeX algorithms in this small system.
This would be your best partner as long as used for your personal use.
